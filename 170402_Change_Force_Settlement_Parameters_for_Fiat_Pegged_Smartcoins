Last year we have apply the same change - 1% as forcesettlement compensation and 0.5% as forcesettlement limit -  to bitUSD and bitCNY, and after the change we saw that force settlement still happen now and then, but shorters now do not worry too much to be force settled, on the other hand, there's no big will from holders to do force settlement as it's not easy to make profit via this way. we can say that the change bring the expected consequence to bitUSD and bitCNY, it reduce the risk of shorting and encourage the shorters to provide more smartcoin supply.  

Other than bitCNY and bitUSD, in Bitshares there are also smartcoins that pegged fiats including EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, TRY, SGD, HKD, RUB, SEK, NZD, MXN, CAD, CHF, AUD, ARS. most of these smartcoins have little supply, however some of them are potential to become wildly used, for example bitEUR, for the same reason that we modify bitCNY and bitUSD, I now suggest to apply the same change to all the smartcoins mentioned above - set force settlement offset to 1% and max settle volume to 0.5%

as ARS have already 1% as force settlement offset and 2% as max settle volume limit, this time ARS will be left unchanged, it can also help us to observe how a different max settle volume influence the behavior of one smartcoin.

regarding other smartcoins as bitBTC, bitSILVER, bitGOLD etc, as what they peg are not stable in price by themselves and then they are different with the fiat pegged smartcoins, this time the suggested change will not touch these smartcoins.

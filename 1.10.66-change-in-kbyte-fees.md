Special Note: Due to the urgency of the security of the network related to this matter the proposal was given less than 24hrs to be approved. This may have been the reason some member accounts did not approve.

Objective
-------
It was brought to the attention of the Committee that there was a potential attack vector in the fee structure relating to kb charges for transactions. Members of the committee recognized that with very little BTS it would have been possible to fill the blockchain with a large amount of data. Fees per kb were 0.00002 BTS. This would mean it would only take 200BTS to upload as much as 1GB of data. 

Review
-------
Due to the nature of the security threat it was decided to pass a proposal to fix the issue and then announce the adjustment to avoid a possible attack once the potential for the attack vector became public. Discussion and review spanned a few days in-between debates over other fees. Tests were done both on private testnets as well as the live network. Results of the tests showed that the threat was real and required immediate response.

Solution
-------
After extensive consultation consensus to support the proposal was reached. Any fees which were priced at 0.0002 BTS were raised to 2 BTS. Following this approval, we are notifying the community of the increase for the security of the network.

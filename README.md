# Proposals

The purpose of this repository is to publicly track and discuss
proposals before and while they are under development.

1. Every proposal should have its own Markdown formated file with a date
   as prefix, e.g. `160208_feeschedule.md`.
2. Every committee member should publicly state his opinion on every
   single proposal even if they have a neutral position.
